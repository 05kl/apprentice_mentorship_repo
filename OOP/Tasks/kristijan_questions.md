**Abstraction vs. Encapsulation – What exactly is the difference?**
 
**I know that encapsulation hides attributes and methods using access modifiers, and abstraction hides implementation details — but how exactly is that achieved?**
 
**Inheritance – Is multiple inheritance allowed in C#?**
 
**Polymorphism – Could you show a small code snippet where we can see both method overriding and method overloading?**
 
**Recursion – When using recursive functions, where are variables stored? What exactly happens in memory during recursion?**
 
**Anonymous Classes – Have you heard about them? What happens if we create code like this:**
**(check branch anonymous-classes-example)**
 
**Hashing vs. Encryption – What’s the difference between them?**
 
**Garbage Collection – Can developers trigger the garbage collector manually? Also, what is the purpose of IDisposable?**
 
**Aggregation vs. Composition – Could you provide a code example using a House and Room class to show both relationships?**
